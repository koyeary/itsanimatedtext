# Tumblr & E-Commerce Platform
## Description
RESTful ecommerce, blogging and content-management API using MERN+Redux.

An in-development project for a pioneering, viral digital-media artist, this application fulfills the client's unique grab-bag of needs, saving the client significant time and money: 
* a full-service ecommerce platform (inventory-management and storefront)
* Ability to post to - and interact with - tumblr and twitter.
* presskit
* Focused access to the constant stream of custom requests (a fundamental requirement of her business) that typically come from all three of these sources.


## API Credits:
* Stripe for payments and accounting.
* Tumblr, Twitter, and Instagram APIs.
* Nodemailer
* React-bootstrap

## Installation
Not just yet! This is an in-development project so I can show off what I'm working on today.
